Remote sensing, as the term used nowadays, refers to acquisition of information from airborne and satellite platforms. Acquired information is electromagnetic (EM) radiation emitted or reflected from Earth. It is a powerful tool for observing land surface, atmosphere and oceans which results in many applications in different fields such as meteorology, ecology, global change studies, agriculture, sociology, urban studies and many others \cite{J13}.

Remote sensing activities can be divided into groups according to the different regions of EM spectrum. The boundaries between EM regions are not sharply defined. According to Zemek et al. \cite{Z14} the EM regions can be divided into visible (0.4 – \SI{0.72}{\micro\meter}), near infrared (0.72 – \SI{1.3}{\micro\meter}), short-wave infrared (1.3 – \SI{3}{\micro\meter}), mid-wave infrared (3 – \SI{8}{\micro\meter}), long-wave infrared (8 – \SI{14}{\micro\meter}) and microwave (\SI{1}{\milli\meter}~–~\SI{1}{\meter}). First three mentioned EM regions are mostly used for acquisition of reflected EM radiation. The EM radiation in long-wave infrared region, also widely called \textit{thermal} infrared region, contains radiation, which is mainly emitted. Mid-wave infrared consists of mixture of reflected and emitted EM radiation. Microwave radiation is used by radar systems for active and passive remote sensing. Data acquisition is also limited by atmosphere transmittance, which can be very weak between individual regions.

%Remote sensing can be divided into several categories according to the purpose of use.
%For example in visible and near infrared region of electromagnetic spectrum (\SI{0.4}{} – \SI{1.3}{\micro\meter}) are usually used CCDs (Charge-Coupled Device). However, in thermal region of electromagnetic spectrum (8 – \SI{14}{\micro\meter}) are used MCT (mercury cadmium telluride) detectors or microbolometric detectors. 
According to the number of spectral bands and its widths, sensors are divided into broadband, multispectral and hyperspectral. Broadband sensors are continuously sensitive within the one region of EM spectrum, multispectral sensors consists of few, rather wide, spectral bands and hyperspectral sensors acquire data in many very narrow spectral bands. 

The previous splittings set the scope for the contents of this treatise. The treatise focuses on theory and methodology for temperature and emissivity separation from data acquired by airborne thermal hyperspectral sensor. In other words, the data are acquired by airborne sensor recording emitted EM radiation in region of 8 – \SI{14}{\micro\meter} in several narrow bands. Airborne thermal hyperspectral data offers valuable information, which is useful in fields focused on evapotranspiration \cite{PP12}, vegetation \cite{RC10}, soil moisture \cite{SF12}, mineral mapping \cite{NK14}, urban studies \cite{SO12}, gas plumes identification \cite{PM05} and others.

The first airborne thermal multispectral sensor was developed in 1980 by NASA JPL. This sensor consists of five multispectral bands in thermal region. Currently operational airborne sensors are Airborne Hyperspectral Scanner (AHS 80) and Spatially Enhanced Broad Array Spectrograph System (SEBASS). To our best knowledge, there are currently three commercially available airborne thermal hyperspectral sensors, namely TASI (Itres Ltd., Calgary, Canada), AISA Owl (Specim Ltd., Oulu, Finland) and Hyper-Cam LW (Telops Inc., Quebec, Canada).

The treatise starts with theoretical background of thermal radiation. In the first section are mentioned fundamental laws and principles necessary for correct understanding of properties of data acquired by airborne thermal hyperspectral sensor. The interpretation of such a data is introduced in the second section together with description~of main difficulty in temperature and emissivity separation. Third section offers overview of~currently used algorithms for temperature and emissivity separation as well as methodologies for atmospheric corrections. In the fourth section are briefly mentioned preliminary results on improvement of one of the temperature and emissivity separation algorithms mentioned in third section. The treatise is enclosed with definition of main aims of the doctoral thesis.

Remote sensing in the thermal infrared (TIR) region of the electromagnetic spectrum provides valuable information about the properties of the observed surfaces, most importantly their physical temperature. But in order to determine physical temperature from observed radiance one must know the emissivity of the surface in the wavelengths being sensed. Data from multispectral and hyperspectral TIR sensors offer the opportunity to derive both the physical temperature as well as an emissivity spectrum, which can be used to characterize the material composition of surfaces. However, observing radiance in $N$ bands yields $N$ equations (Planck's law applied at each wavelength) but $N+1$ unknowns ($N$ emissivities plus temperature). This problem, separating the contributions of temperature and emissivity to observed radiances, has been the subject of a great deal of research and many methods have been developed to address it 
%\cite{li_satellite-derived_2013}.
 
The most widely used spaceborne sensor with multispectral TIR capabilities is the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) launched in December 1999 onboard NASA's Terra platform. Data from ASTER's TIR bands have been used for many applications including 
geology 
%\cite{van_der_meer_multi-_2012}, 
volcanology 
%\cite{pieri_aster_2004}, 
glaciology 
%\cite{foster_physically_2012}, 
soil moisture estimation 
%\cite{scheidt_determining_2010}, 
urban studies 
%\cite{weng_modeling_2011},
and land cover change detection 
%\cite{french_detecting_2008}.
The temperature and emissivity separation algorithm, designated TES, that was developed for the ASTER sensor 
%\cite{gillespie_temperature_1998} 
has since found widespread use with other multispectral and hyperspectral sensors.

Although the TES algorithm is already capable of producing reasonably accurate results it could be made more robust, precise and widely applicable by reducing the number of the assumptions that it makes. In particular, for materials with low spectral contrast TES often produces anomalous emissivity spectra 
%\cite{coll_temperature_2007, sobrino_accuracy_2007}. 
These spectra suffer from a large degree of noise, which can be explained by various thresholds included in TES. In fact, as will be described in later sections, the TES-derived standard kinetic temperature and emissivity data products distributed by the Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC) are inconsistent, i.e. they are not related with respect to the radiative transfer equation.

This paper focuses on enhancing the accuracy and precision of the products generated by the TES algorithm. The main improvement is accomplished by replacing one of the TES modules with a newly designed one that takes advantage of a relationship between brightness temperature and emissivity. The performance of our improved TES algorithm, which we call OSTES (Optimized Smoothing for Temperature Emissivity Separation), is firstly tested on a set of simulated data representing different natural materials as they would be acquired by various multispectral and hyperspectral sensors. Then it is applied \textcolor{red}{to} the ASTER standard land-leaving and downwelling radiance product AST\_09T and the results are compared with \textcolor{red}{the} ASTER emissivity and surface kinetic temperature standard products AST\_08 and AST\_05, respectively.
